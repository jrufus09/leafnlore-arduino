**Leaf and Lore** is an architectual, arduino-based piece in response to a design brief of plant-centric care. Our target audience, tester and lead plant representative is Atanas' rattlesnake plant, Jesse.

The aim of our project is to encourage a human plant parent (or caretaker) to engage in a ritualistic form of plant care -- that is, consistently checking on, watering and misting the plant -- and then be able to reap the rewards through the system's response.

Through ambient light and sound, one can meditate and relax whilst building the habit of care and enhancing the lives of both human and plant.

The code above is an example of the ritual and sunset routine. The ritual occurs earlier in the day whilst the sunset (caretaker reward) routine occurs in response to a successful ritual completion. At sunset, the lights and ambient sound triggers, whilst earlier in the day, the drum indicates it's time to look after the plant.
